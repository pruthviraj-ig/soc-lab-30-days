SOC Investigation Scenario — Workbooks & Lookups Triage

Alert:
Suspicious activity involving VPN brute force and internal network access path

Scenario Summary:
Used SOC workbooks and lookup resources to investigate alerts using structured decision trees. Followed investigation flowcharts to validate IP activity, user behavior, subnet roles, and expected network access patterns.

Steps Taken:
- Reviewed SOC workbook investigation model
- Used investigation flowcharts to guide triage steps
- Checked asset and identity records
- Mapped IP addresses to subnets using network diagram
- Identified exposed services by port number
- Verified which subnet a host IP belongs to
- Traced attacker path across VPN → subnet → internal targets
- Used workbook logic to determine escalation vs closure
- Applied structured decision points instead of guesswork
- Completed Email Analysis workbook
- Completed PowerShell Analysis workbook
- Completed Network Analysis workbook

Lookup Actions Performed:
- User identity lookup
- Asset role lookup
- Network subnet classification
- Port-to-service mapping
- IP reputation context
- Login location validation workflow
- Internal port scanning investigation workflow

Indicators Observed:
- External IP performing VPN brute force
- Successful VPN authentication after repeated failures
- Lateral movement attempt toward database subnet
- Firewall blocking database subnet access
- Switch to office subnet targeting

Skills Practiced:
- Workbook-driven triage
- SOC decision tree usage
- Asset and identity enrichment
- Network diagram interpretation
- Port and service mapping
- Structured escalation criteria
- Repeatable investigation workflow

Key Learning:
SOC workbooks standardize investigations and reduce analyst error. Using lookup sources and decision trees ensures consistent triage, faster enrichment, and correct escalation decisions across shifts.
