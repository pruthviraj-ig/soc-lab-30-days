# SOC Analyst Practical Lab — 30 Day Detection & Investigation Project

This repository documents my hands-on SOC Analyst lab training and investigation exercises focused on security monitoring, alert triage, alert reporting, escalation workflow, enrichment lookups, and SOC investigation methodology.

The project is structured as a day-by-day practical portfolio demonstrating repeatable SOC investigation and documentation practices.
