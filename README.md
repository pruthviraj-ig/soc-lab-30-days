# SOC Analyst Practical Lab — 30 Day Detection & Investigation Project

This repository documents my hands-on **SOC Analyst training labs**, detection exercises, and investigation walkthroughs focused on real-world SOC workflows, alert triage, SIEM analysis, and Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR).

The project demonstrates practical blue team skills aligned with **SOC L1 / Junior SOC Analyst** job requirements.
