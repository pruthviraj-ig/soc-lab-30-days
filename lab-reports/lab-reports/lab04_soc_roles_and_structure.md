Lab 02: SOC Roles & Blue Team Structure Report
Lab Title: SOC Role in Blue Team — Security Structure & Incident Responsibilities
Platform Used: TryHackMe
Objective: Familiarize yourself with the structure of a Security Operations Center (SOC), how different security roles interoperate, how incident handling is performed by various teams like SOC analyst, CIRT, GRC, and Red Team.

Topics Covered:
Hierarchy of security inside an organization
SOC Team Structure (L1, L2, L3
Role of CISO and SOC Manager
Difference between Blue Team, Red Team & GRC
CIRT (Cyber Incident Response Team)
Internal SOC vs MSSP     
Role-based incident handling scenarios

Key Concepts Learned:
Security Hierarchy
An organization’s leadership structure comprises a layered security leadership model:
CEO/Executives
Business Decisions
CISO / CIO / CTO — Security Leadership
SOC Manager/Team Leads Team operations
SOC Analysts / Engineers – Technical Monitoring & Response Executives do not deal with technical alerts but with security leadership.

SOC Analyst Levels:
SOC L1:
First line of defense
Monitor alerts
Basic triage
Escalate incidents

SOC L2:
Deeper investigation
Validate threats
Correlate logs

SOC L3:
Advanced investigation
Threat hunting
Complex incident response

CIRT / CSIRT / CERT Team: Also called Cyber Firefighters
Responsibilities:
Handle critical incidents
Deep forensic analysis
Threat containment
System recovery
Called when SOC escalation is not enough

Roles include:
CIRT Manager
Forensics Lead
Threat Intelligence Expert
Threat Hunter
Malware Analyst

Security Teams Overview:
Blue Team :
Defensive security
Monitor alerts
Protect systems
Respond to incidents

Red Team:
Simulate attackers
Perform penetration testing
Find weaknesses

GRC Team:
Governance, Risk, Compliance
Create policies
Ensure regulatory compliance
Conduct audits

Internal SOC vs MSSP:

Internal SOC
Works inside one company
Focused on single environment
Stable workflow

MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)
Handles multiple clients
High alert volume
Faster pace
Multi-environment exposure
Scenario Exercise Completed

In the interactive role assignment exercise:
Correct security roles were matched to incident scenarios
Tasks were assigned based on responsibility:
SOC L1 → alert triage
CERT Lead → ransomware response
GRC Auditor → PCI DSS audit
Threat Researcher → threat group analysis
Penetration Tester → vulnerability testing
SOC Engineer → SIEM storage issue

All tasks completed successfully.

Skills Practiced
SOC role identification
Incident responsibility mapping
Security team structure understanding
Escalation path awareness
Blue team operational flow

Outcome:
This lab improved understanding of how SOC teams are organized and how different cybersecurity roles collaborate during incidents. It clarified escalation paths and helped map technical problems to the correct security specialists.
