# Lab 02 — Humans as Attack Vectors & Phishing Defense

## Platform Used
TryHackMe

## Room / Module
Humans as Attack Vectors

---

## Objective

Understand how attackers target humans instead of systems using social engineering techniques, and learn how SOC teams detect and mitigate these attacks.

---

## Topics Covered

- Humans as weakest security link
- Social engineering attacks
- Phishing campaigns
- Deepfake & impersonation attacks
- Insider threats
- Trust exploitation methods
- Mitigation vs Detection strategy
- Employee security awareness

---

## Attack Techniques Studied

- Phishing emails with malicious links
- Fake login pages
- CEO / IT impersonation
- Urgency & emotional manipulation
- Deepfake voice/video scams
- USB drop attacks
- Fake job offers

---

## Defense & Mitigation Measures

- Anti-phishing tools
- Email filtering
- Antivirus / EDR protection
- Trust-but-verify principle
- Employee security awareness training
- Phishing simulation exercises
- User reporting process

---

## Practical Lab Work Completed

- Opened TryHackMe Security Dashboard simulation
- Investigated employees at risk
- Identified phishing indicators
- Flagged malicious emails
- Helped protect 4 simulated employees from phishing
- Reviewed and updated company security policy
- Completed all lab tasks (100%)

---

## Key Indicators of Phishing Identified

- Suspicious sender domain
- Urgent language
- Credential request links
- Fake login portals
- Unexpected attachments
- Mismatch between link text and URL

---

## SOC Analyst Learning Outcome

This lab demonstrated that:

- Many real attacks succeed through human manipulation
- Prevention is partly technical and partly educational
- SOC teams rely on both tools and user awareness
- Detection + mitigation must work together
- Security policy and training reduce risk significantly

---

## Personal Notes

This lab improved my ability to:
- Recognize phishing patterns
- Analyze suspicious messages
- Understand attacker psychology
- Apply mitigation controls
- Think like a SOC defender
